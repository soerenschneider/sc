## sc vault login

Authenticate with a Vault server using username and password

### Synopsis

Authenticate with a HashiCorp Vault server using the "userpass" authentication method.

This command logs you into Vault using a username and password. If two-factor
authentication is enabled, you may also provide a one-time password (OTP).

After successful login, a Vault token is returned. The token is saved to a file.
If the file cannot be written—due to permission issues or missing directories—the token is printed
to stdout as a fallback.

```
